## Logarithms Are Hard (Web, 151 points, 201 solves)

    What is e^(1.000000001)?
    
    Please enter in decimal with 7 places.
    (For example, if the answer was 2.71828183... the flag would be 2.7182818 )

In classic PlaidCTF fashion we have another "X are hard" challenge. A quick google search for `logarithm bug` gives us http://www.datamath.org/Story/LogarithmBug.htm. Further down the page we see the logarithm section we care about _The yx Function_. Our n value is 1,000,000,000 for 9 places, and in the table we see **2.7191928**.
